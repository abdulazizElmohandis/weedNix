### Overview

This repository provides scripts to generate plant models for simulation within a defined farm area. The generated plant arrangements include both straight-line and sinusoidal patterns with options for uniform and random spacing.

---

## Workspace (Farm Area)

The plants are generated within the farm area defined in `farmWith1CropRow.world` with the following boundary points:
- (-18, -10)
- (-18, 10)
- (21, 10)
- (21, -10)

## Contents

- **Generate Plants in Straight Lines:**  
  - **`generate_plants_straight_lines.py`**  
    Generates plant models arranged in straight lines. Two variations are available:
    - **Uniform Arrangement:**  
      Plants are evenly spaced with a fixed delta_x (0.6) and no Y offset.
    - **Random Arrangement:**  
      Plants are placed with a random delta_x (between 0.21 and 0.74) plus a small x_offset, and a random Y offset is added.

- **Generate Plants in Sinusoidal Pattern:**  
  - **`sin_plants_generate.py`**  
    Generates plant models following a sine wave pattern. Two variations are available:
    - **Uniform Sinusoidal Arrangement:**  
      Plants are arranged along a sine wave defined by configurable amplitude and frequency, with uniform spacing.
    - **Random Sinusoidal Arrangement:**  
      Plants are distributed along the sine wave with small random modifications to X and Y coordinates, keeping them close to the sine curve.

- **Additional Files:**  
  - **`Root_straight_lines_plants_generate.py`** – An alternate script for generating straight-line arrangements.  
  - **`Root_Word_no_tree.txt`** – A supporting text file containing further notes or instructions.

## Parameters

Each script allows you to customize the following parameters:
- **`num_rows`**: Number of rows.
- **`row_length`**: Length of each row.
- **`row_spacing`**: Distance between rows.
- **`original_x`, `original_y`**: Starting position for the first row.

For sinusoidal arrangements, additional parameters include:
- **`amplitude`**: Controls the vertical oscillation (height) of the sine wave.
- **`frequency`**: Controls the number of oscillations per unit distance.

---

## Usage

1. Run the desired script. For example, for straight-line generation:
   ```bash
   python3 generate_plants_straight_lines.py
   ```
   or for sinusoidal generation:
   ```bash
   python3 sin_plants_generate.py
   ```
2. The output file (`plants.sdf`) will be created with the generated plant models.

## Modifications and Enhancements

- **Controlled Randomness:**  
  The scripts allow for both uniform and random placements. In random mode, small adjustments (x_offset and y_offset) are applied to the X and Y coordinates, respectively, to introduce variability while still maintaining overall row alignment.

- **Sinusoidal Pattern Generation:**  
  The sine-based scripts generate plants along a sine wave. By adjusting the **amplitude** and **frequency** parameters, you can control:
  - **Amplitude:** The vertical height of the sine wave.
  - **Frequency:** The number of oscillations over a given horizontal distance.

- **Multiple Plant Groups:**  
  The repository ultimately generates six sets of plant arrangements:
  - **Three groups on the left (uniform) and three groups on the right (random).**  
  - The first group has rows spaced 1 meter apart.  
  - The second and third groups have rows spaced 2 meters apart.  
  - The third group features sinusoidal planting patterns.

This modular design enables easy customization and experimentation with different planting patterns and densities.
